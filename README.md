# GifTastic


Giftastic makes buttons from an array, it also allows users to add buttons.
It also allows users to click on a button and 10 gifs on that subject will display.
If the user clicks on one of the gif's it animates.
If they click again it goes still.

The project is a good example of how to add buttons to a html using javascript.

If anyone is interested they can run the index html and check out the buttons.

You can change the javascript file that is used int he html file, by linking javascriptSearch.js instead of javascriptRandom.js

The difference is that for one it does a regular search and the other it randomizes the gifs each time.
