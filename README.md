# GifTastic


Giftastic makes buttons from an array, it also allows users to add buttons.
It also allows users to click on a button and 10 gifs on that subject will display.
If the user clicks on one of the gif's it animates.
If they click again it goes still.

The project is a good example of how to add buttons to a html using javascript.

If anyone is interested they can run the index html and check out the buttons.
